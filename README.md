<h1 align="center">Gym Database</h1>
<h2 align="center">By Christopher Linscott</h2>

### What is it?

This is a replication of a gym database one may use in storing and representing the data
for a small-scale gym keeping track of members and employees. 

While this doesn't include all aspects (such as job scheduling, workouts, and many other features), this is a great start on what a gym database may look like.

### How can I get it started up?

First of all, git clone the repo into your current working directory, in your
favorite text editor (like VSCode, Atom, etc.).



### How does it work? / How is it designed?

Here's an ER diagram:

The DDL, or way tables and relationships are designed, is made around this 
ER diagram as well as keeping everything in [BCNF Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form).
